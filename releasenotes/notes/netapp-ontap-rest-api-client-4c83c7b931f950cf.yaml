    NetApp driver: it has now the option to request ONTAP operations through
    REST API. The new option `netapp_use_legacy_client` allows switching
    between the old ZAPI client approach and new REST client. It is default
    to `True`, meaning that the drivers will keep working as before using ZAPI
    operations. If desired, this option can be set to `False` connecting with
    new REST client that performs REST API operations if it is available,
    otherwise falls back to ZAPI.
